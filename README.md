# Automotive-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
Built an interactive Automotive Sales Performance Dashboard in Power BI to track KPIs like total sales, growth, and channel performance. Used DAX, data modeling, and interactive slicers to analyze trends, segments, and regions, enabling data-driven insights for revenue planning and strategic decisions.

🚗 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 | 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗜 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁

With the automotive industry rapidly advancing through digital transformation and data-led sales strategies, I wanted to understand how analytics drives revenue forecasting, demand planning, and performance optimization across vehicle segments and regions.

This led me to design and develop an interactive 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗶𝗻 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗜 that simulates how sales leadership teams monitor revenue, growth, sales mix, and customer performance using KPI-driven insights and structured multi-page navigation.
